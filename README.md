### About
The purpose of this repository is to give students a reference for their final projects. If you find yourself getting
stuck on anything, one of these projects may have an answer for you.

Remember, this code should be read and reviewed, not copied and pasted. Even if you want to use a project to jump-start
your project, write out the whole thing. It's good practice.
