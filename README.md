# starter-kits

### About
The purpose of this repository is to give students a reference for their final projects. If you find yourself getting
stuck on anything, one of these projects may have an answer for you.

Remember, this code should be read and reviewed, not copied and pasted. Even if you want to use a project to jump-start
your project, write out the whole thing. It's good practice.

### Project Features
1. vanilla-skeleton

The most basic boilerplate. Includes two pages, home and about, functional links between them, and connected to CSS and JS

2. bootstrap-skeleton

If you want to use a CSS library like bootstrap, this boilerplate outlines how to do that.

It includes two pages, home and about, functional links between them, bootstrap and fontawesome included via CDN, a theme.css
with Google Material Design, and a style.css for your own styles.

3. chartjs-skeleton

If you want to use any kind of charting, I've provided an example using a library called [chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/).
Also included is the standard bootstrap CDN, with no theme applied to it (only using the container class in this example).

4. api-fetch-skeleton

This project has only an index.html, style.css, and main.js (no pages, libraries, etc.), but shows how to get data from an API like Giphy.
Note that if you want to do this in your own projects, we should review the API in question before building anything.
